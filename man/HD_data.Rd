\title{Mice models with Huntingtonâ€™s disease}
\format{
A list containing two sub-lists of data \code{FullData},
\code{EgData}:
\describe{
\item{FullData}{A list containing two data sets: \code{X.count}
which are the raw data represented as a matrix with 30 samples and 368 OTUs;
\code{metadata} which is a data frame containing the meta data information
of samples in \code{X.count}.}
\item{EgData}{A list containing three data sets: \code{X.clr} which are the
filtered and centered log ratio transformed data including 30 samples and 269
OTUs from the raw data in the \code{FullData} list; \code{Y.trt} which is a
factor of genotypes for each sample that is the effect of interest in the HD
study; \code{Y.bat} which is a factor of cages where the mice were housed
for each sample treated as the batch effect.}}

\description{
This study explored differences in microbial composition between Huntington's
disease (HD) and wild-type (WT) mice. The samples were collected from the
mice with different genotypes and housed in different cages. This study
includes a nested batch x treatment design.
