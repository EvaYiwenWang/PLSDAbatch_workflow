\value{
\code{simData} returns a list that contains the following components:

\item{cleanData}{The ground-truth data without the batch effect.}
\item{Y.trt}{The simulated outcome variable indicating the treatment
grouping information.}

\description{
This function simulates data with treatment or/and batch effects
under different \code{batch x treatment design}
using component-based and multivariate strategy.

\examples{
## First example
## Balanced batch x treatment design
i = 1
simulation1 <- simData(bat.mean = 7, sd.bat = 8, trt.mean = 3, sd.trt = 2,
                       N = 40, p_total = 300, p_trt_relevant = 60,
                       p_bat_relevant = 150,
                       percentage_samples = 0.5,
                       percentage_overlap_variables = 0.5)

## Second example
## Unbalanced batch x treatment design
i = 1
simulation2 <- simData(bat.mean = 7, sd.bat = 8, trt.mean = 3, sd.trt = 2,
                       N = 40, p_total = 300, p_trt_relevant = 60,
                       p_bat_relevant = 150,
                       percentage_samples = 0.2,
                       percentage_overlap_variables = 0.5)
